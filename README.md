# my-js-phase-1-project

This project is a advice generator.  It pulls advice at random over any topic from a public API on github! There are no real instructions other than load up the page and start generating the advice by clicking the "Fresh Advice" button.  

In the middle of your screen you will see the randomly generated advice.  If you find it helpful or unhelpful then there are two buttons "Helpful Advice" and "Unhelpful Advice"  sort the advice accordingly on how you feel!  

Now lets say that you have cycled through a bunch of advice and decide this is not actually helpful advice.  Then go ahead to your saved Helpful Advice list and click on the one you no longer find helpful and it will remove it!  

 Since this project is using and pulling data from an public API there is no installation required. 

 At the moment.  In the future I plan on expanding this into a JSON server and building upon this project!

 There are no special circumstance to run this project!
