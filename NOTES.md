# Project Proposal

A website that randomly gives insightful pieces of advice.  Ones that the user will see and either be able to say is good advice or terrible advice.  The good advice will be saved to a list on the webpage. And also the bad advice will have a seperate list as well.  

## MVP
- User will be able to load the page see the first piece of advice.
- User will be able to cycle through pieces of advise. 

## Stretch 
- Users can temporarily save advice according to what they think is good advice or bad advice.
- Styling
- Users can also remove advice from the lists.
